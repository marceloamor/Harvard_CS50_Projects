    Pages
        Homepage-
            intro and summary of pages to come
            some nonsense about history of crypto, etc, anything to make it look full perhaps

        Web analysis sample
            an input box that returns the coin with a $ before it
            and some sample text that's like "if this were fully functional, we would tell you: from reddit, twitter, sentiment, # of mentions, etc
